          This project marked the launch of jani. We planted our first tree in
          Karura forest, located in Nairobi, Kenya
        </h2>

            At Jani, we’re excited to share something close to our hearts. We
            plan to plant over 500 trees in Karura Forest, one of Nairobi’s most
            beautiful and historic green spaces. This initiative is more than
            just about planting trees, it’s about connecting with nature,
            preserving our environment, and making a meaningful impact on the
            world around us.

              As we’ve prepared for this project, we’ve had the privilege of
              meeting David, one of Karura’s long-time workers. Spending time
              with him has been a highlight of this journey. David knows the
              forest like the back of his hand, and his passion for conservation
              is contagious. He introduced us to some of the tree species we’ll
              be planting, explaining their importance to Karura’s ecosystem and
              how each species has a unique role to play. For example, some
              species provide food and shelter for wildlife, sustaining
              biodiversity and offering protection to vulnerable animals, while
              others play a crucial role in preventing soil erosion and
              purifying the air. His deep knowledge of Karura's flora and fauna
              opened our eyes to how interconnected everything in the forest
              truly is. David’s stories brought these trees to life, making us
              even more excited to get started on this journey to create a
              lasting impact.

              But what stuck with us was hearing about Karura’s history. David
              shared how the forest was once under threat from development and
              how the dedication of environmentalists like Wangari Maathai saved
              it. Today, it’s a place of peace, beauty, and resilience, a
              reminder of what we can achieve when we come together to protect
              our planet.The transformation of Karura into a thriving ecosystem
              also inspires local communities to take pride in its preservation
              and benefits. It’s a testament to the unwavering spirit of those
              who fought for its survival and the ongoing importance of
              nurturing its biodiversity. As we look ahead to this tree-planting
              day, we’re reminded that small actions, like planting a tree, can
              lead to big changes. Each sapling we plant represents hope for the
              future, hope for a healthier environment, and a greener Kenya.

            As we look ahead to this tree-planting day, we’re reminded that
            small actions, like planting a tree, can lead to big changes over
            time. Each sapling we plant represents hope for the future, hope for
            a healthier environment, and a greener Kenya. These trees will one
            day grow into towering giants, providing shade, cleaning the air,
            and supporting wildlife for generations to come.
             We’d love for you to be part
            of this journey with us. Whether it’s joining us on the planting day
            or simply spreading the word, every bit of support counts. Let’s
            work together to make Karura even greener and show what’s possible
            when we care for our environment.
